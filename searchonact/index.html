                    detected in the field of <b>privacy</b> and <b>culture</b>, to the proposal of a solution that can
                    deliver value and contribute to solving the problem.

                <h3 style="padding: 10px 0;">— THE DIGITAL GAP</h3>
                <p> The problem that we decide to investigate is the one generated from the <b>digital divide</b>. <br>
                    The digital divide refers to the inequality in access, use, or impact of Information and
                    Communication Technologies (ICT) between social groups.

                    Traditionally considered primarily a question of access, today, with global cell phone penetration
                    at over 95%, inequalities arise between those with more and less bandwidth and more or less
                    associated technological skills.

                    Inequality in access to technology is also a form of social exclusion, especially in times of
                    COVID-19. To the extent that we smooth this fissure, we are underpinning a more secure structure for
                    people. Empowering people in vulnerable situations increase their autonomy, promotes equality, and
                    makes us better as a society.</p>

            <div class="project-text-space">
                <h3 style="padding: 10px 0;">— THE ACTUAL CONTEXT</h3>
                <p> One of the first things that we discovered by starting to interview people about their digital
                    experiences related to culture, was the <b>duality</b> between what people say and what they
                    actually do when they are on these digital platforms sharing
                    their data and accepting everything, even without knowing exactly what companies do with their
                    personal information. We heard stories about people willing to pay millions for immaterial things
                    like NFTs or to buy expensive things in the metaverse, when they didn't know and don't even realize
                    that we are facing a real tangile problem that is affecting 2.9 billions people who still don't
                    access to internet today.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-text">

            <div class="project-text-space">
                <h3 style="padding: 10px 0; text-transform: uppercase;">— Privacy and culture as...</h3>
                <p> At this point, we have arrived at our definition of the two main themes of the project: "culture" as
                    a connection between people and knowledge sharing and "privacy" as understanding the use and value
                    of personal data on the net.
                    We linked these 2 areas and came up with terms such as: connection, knowledge, diversity, and a safe
                    navigation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-text-space">
                <h3 style="padding: 10px 0; text-transform: uppercase;">— Applied discovery methodologies</h3>
                <p> In this first phase, we did more than 20 interviews that allowed us to get into context, hear
                    directly
                    from people their thoughts and concerns, and in this way develop <b>empathy</b>. <br>
                    We also found it very helpful to do an extensive research on different channels - such as articles,
                    blogs, videos, recorded interviews, and podcasts - to be able to understand and adopt the point of
                    view of other main actors involved in this problem, which we might never have been able to meet
                    physically.
                    <br>
                    Finally, a very important tool was the creation of several <b>Customer Journey Maps</b> about
                    digital shopping experiences
                    for cultural events, as an example of an online moment where personalization is sought.
                    With this, we realized that in all of our user's customer journay maps a vicious circle is generated
                    in which there are always the
                    same big digital companies that put their own benefits before people's real needs, thus
                    contribuiting to widen the digital divide.

                <p>We started by defining our archetypes, our model users, by using a matrix in which we used two
                    lenses: people's knowledge about privacy and their frequency of use of digital devices.
                    As you can see in the image below we prioritized 2 archetypes which may be considered like
                    opposites, the "always connected" and the "unconnected".

                <p> The next step was to define how the primary personas of our product.
                    They would be: <br>
                    - web users with internet access located all over the world, who
                    search the internet to consume visual, informative, and cultural contents. <br>

                    - constantly connected people, regular internet users who use their mobile or computer to perform
                    daily searches. <br>
                    - they usually "accept everything" before accessing a digital service because they think that
                    nowadays
                    "privacy no longer exists". <br>

                    - they are aware of the problem of the digital divide and have a moral sense of social
                    responsibility,
                    they value to have the possibility to generate social benefits through their actions.

                <p> At this point, from everything we discovered in the discovery phase, we collect insights and
                    prioritize
                    them in order to define an <b>how might we scenario </b> together with our main challenges. We
                    developed 5 insights and for each of them described an how might we question, which later on we
                    reduced at two main challenges as they were considered the most relevant also by our users.
                    <br>

                    Or in other words: how can we restore the true value of our individual privacy by acting within the
                    digital world? <br>
                    It was at this point that we started to look for a way that would allow digital users to continue
                    with exactly the same as they normally do in
                    all digital experiences, more specifically to use services in exchange for their personal data and
                    preferences, but by using the
                    legal obligation to share valuable data and transforming it into a possibility to generate revenue
                    to concretely solve the problem of the digital divide.

                    At this stage together with the class group, we had a nrainstorming session, through which we
                    collected several ideas and then we prioritzed them and clustered by 4 main themes into an affinity
                    map through which we selected the ones that we thought could bring more value to our users and so

                    The so called "coolture time" part is designed with the aim of offering a more social, informative

                <p>Once we had a clear idea and designed the first <b>low fidelity prototype</b>, we started to test
                    directly with our users. <br>
                    The first tests we did were conducted through 2 different prototypes that represented the 2 parts,
                    the browser and the widgets. Our goal was to see if users understood the concept and if the would
                    have valued to have a more social-interactive tool while surfing the internet, which the great
                    majority of the interviewed did.

                <p><b>User tests - Iterating the prototype</b> <br>
                    Next, we unified everything in a prototype and started testing the experience with a focus on the
                    mobile design. <br>
                    We gave 4 different tasks to perform within the prototype to 15 users.
                    The goal was to see if the whole navigation flow made sense in the different sections and also to
                    check if we solved the previously detected needs.
                    Below you can see briefly the changes we made thanks to these tests since the first version of the
                    prototype.

                <p> <b>User testing - Co-creation</b> <br>
                    In the last stages of this phase, we thought of adding at the end of the tests a part of co-creation
                    with our users
                    through 6 interactive activities related to the prototype to validate it and its value proposition,
                    prioritize functionalities that they valued the most, and generating new ideas.
                    <br>
                    It has been a very interesting and useful activity as well as really entertaining, as it has given
                    us many insights on improvements that we could do and also confirmed doubts that we had, and above
                    all, we have
                    been able to generate together with the users more than 65 new ideas for future features that they

                <p>As seen from the images displayed so far, we started working on the desktop version of the product at
                    the beginning of the project, but we later decided to prioritize mobile for
                    the moment because lots of users and our chosen archetype, the "always connected", are mostly mobile
                    users, as they also described it as an "extension of their hand". <br>
                    Moreover, we liked the possibility of designing this version in order to learn and apply the
                    <b>mobile first design mentality</b>.

                <p>To summarize what we have said so far and before showing in detail the MVP of our prototype,
                    I's like to introduce the backlog or road map of this project for a better understanding, and to
                    show that we have were able to deliver the MVP in 3 sprints. <br>
                    In the image below, you can see our 4 big headlines or <b>epics</b> that summarize the user needs or
                    <b>user stories</b>
                    that we have been
                    continuously interrogating, to see how we have executed each of them from test-derived decisions.
                    <br>
                    Thanks to this constant iteration, you will see that the "coolture time" epic has now become
                    "widgets" and we use the term "website" when referring to the "landing page" as it has grow into a
                    complete <a class="" href="#website"> website</a>.

                        about
                        it." </i> <br>

                    We have solved this need through the website in the about section and in the product, where from the
                    setting menu in the homepage you can easily
                    enter the about us, FAQ, or terms and conditions sections to have all the information available.
                    <br>
                    As you can read from this first epic and from the next, our focus has been on differentiating
                    between new users (who
                    don't know the
                    brand and will go to the landing page for info) and users who are already moving into our product,
                    as both will have different needs.

                    Here you can see the sitemap format that illustrates the hierarchy of the content across a website
                    and the expected user flows. Tests were made at this point using various <b>card sorting</b>
                    activities.

                    <i>"I as a SearchOnAct user want to easily browse the web to find content."</i> <br>
                    We have solved this need by delivering search result for categories (web, news, images, and videos)
                    plus an important part for visual interactive ads which are essentials to generate new internet
                    connections. <br>
                    Thanks to the last feedbacks of our users we have added the possibility to "close" the ad after a
                    few that you
                    discard if they are not of your interest, but at the same time by appealing to the moral sense of
                    the users and making
                    clear in writing that the ads are a fundamental part to continue generating impact. <br>

                        I want to have an interactive navigation so that I can enjoy an entertaining experience.</i>
                    <br>
                    For this epic we have generated 5 widgets - availables so far - that allows customizable
                    functionalities, such as a "did you know" that tells each time new curious facts about the digital
                    divide, a "user and social parters ranking" that we developed to implement the engagement toward the
                    generation of new internet connections through gamification, a "saved items" folder where you can
                    group your searches in customizable dashboards with names and categories, a "feedback" and a "more
                    widgets" part where users can get in tough with us and we can learn from them in order to always
                    delivers value.

                        used.</i> <br>

                    We have solved this on our website through the FAQ section where we explain how SearchOnAct protects
                    the
                    privacy of each user. And we have also solved it in the product, where from the setting section in
                    the homepage you can easily access the terms and
                    conditions and see more in detail how we use the users' data and how we

                <p>Once all the design part of our project was developed, we went on to define the business model part,

                    on
                    promoted ads
                    and we return most of our revenue (70%) to our social partners and use a smaller part for all the
                    necessary
                    resources for the product development.
