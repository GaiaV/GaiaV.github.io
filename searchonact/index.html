                    us to
                    go from the phase of understanding and defining the problem detected in the field of PRIVACY and
                    CULTURE, to the proposal of a solution that can deliver value and contribute to solving the problem.

                <h3 style="padding: 10px 0;">— THE DIGITAL GAP</h3>
                <p> The digital divide refers to the inequality in access, use, or impact of Information and
                    Communication Technologies (ICT) between social groups.

                    Traditionally considered primarily a question of access, today, with global cell phone penetration
                    at over 95%, relative inequality arises between those with more and less bandwidth and more or less
                    associated skills.

                    Inequality in access to technology is also a form of social exclusion, especially in times of
                    COVID-19. To the extent that we smooth this fissure, we are underpinning a more secure structure for
                    people. Empowering people in vulnerable situations increase their autonomy, promotes equality, and
                    makes us better as a society.</p>

                <h3 style="padding: 10px 0;">— THE ACTUAL CONTEXT</h3>
                <p> DUALITY between what people say and what they do when they are on these digital platforms sharing
                    their data and accepting everything without knowing what they do with them and acquiring in exchange
                    their navigation > they are willing to pay millions for immaterial things like NFTs or to buy things
                    in the metaverse and then we are faced with real and current data in which there are 2,900 MILLION
                    who DO NOT HAVE access to internet </p>

                <p> At this point, we have arrived at our definition of the two main themes of the project: "culture" as
                    a connection between people and knowledge sharing and "privacy" as understanding the use and value
                    of personal data on the net.
                    We linked these 2 areas and came up with terms such as: connection, knowledge, diversity, and safe
                    surfing.</p>

            <div class="project-text-space">
                <h3 style="padding: 10px 0; text-transform: uppercase;">— Applied discovery methodologies</h3>
                <p> In this first phase, we did several interviews that allowed us to get into context, hear directly
                    from people their thoughts and concerns, and test empathy.
                    We also found it very helpful to search the media to be able to understand and adopt the point of
                    view of other main actors in this problem, which we might never have been able to find physically.

                    Finally, a very important tool was the creation of several CJMaps about digital shopping experiences
                    for cultural events, as an example of an online moment where personalization is sought.
                    With this, we realized that in all CJMs a vicious circle is generated in which there are always the
                    same big companies that put forward their own benefits, thus widening the digital divide.

                <p> From the interviews and in general, from all research, we have come to define how are the primary
                    users of our product:
                    Users of the web and/or mobile digital devices with internet access located all over the world, who
                    search the internet daily to consume visual, informative, and cultural content.

                    Continuously connected people, regular internet users who use their mobile or computer to perform
                    daily searches.
                    They usually "accept everything" before accessing a digital service because they know that nowadays
                    "privacy no longer exists".

                    They are aware of the issue of the digital divide and have a moral sense of social responsibility,
                    which they value to be able to bring social benefits through their actions.

                <p> At this point, from everything we discovered in the discovery phase, we draw insights and prioritize
                    them in order to define a How might we scenario and define our main challenges.

                    How could we transform this "legal obligation" to accept terms and conditions into benefits for the
                    community and not only for companies?

                    How could we act within the digital transformation of culture so that everyone can be connected for
                    free and unlimited?

                    So, how do we change privacy? That is, how can we restore its true value to our individual privacy
                    by acting within the digital world?
                    So we start looking for a way that allows us to continue with exactly the same as we normally do in
                    all digital experiences, i.e. using services in exchange for our data and preferences, but using the
                    legal obligation to share valuable data and transforming it into a possibility to generate revenue
                    to concretely solve the problem of the digital divide.

                    generate a global social benefit!
                    Instead of keeping all the revenue like other search engines, we give a portion to our non-profit

                    connection to people who don't have one yet.

                    It's also free and costs nothing, because the money raised comes from ads in search results.

                    Also, to allow a safe experience, we take care of your privacy and your personal data during the

                <p>To summarize what we have said so far
                    Before showing in detail the MVP of our prototype,
                    We want to show the backlog or road map for better understanding, and see that we have finished the
                    backlog in 3 sprints.
                    We want to explain the 4 big headlines or epics that summarize the user needs and we have been
                    continuously interrogating:

                    Coolture time > Widgets
                    Landing page > Website

                </div>

                <p>
                    Landing page epic: "Our focus has been on differentiating between new users (who don't know the
                    brand and will go to the landing page for info) and users who are already moving into our product,
                    as both will have different needs".

                    Epica 1 - Landing Page
                    Now, before navigating the prototype let's show the 4 epics defined in our backlog - which summarize
                    the related user stories - and how we have executed each of them to make them more understandable
                    (the decisions made from testing).

                    The first epic is about the landing page:
                    "I as an internet user want to find information about SearchOnAct's service to join and learn about
                    it."

                    We have solved this on the landing page in the about section and in the product, you can also easily
                    enter the about us, FAQ, or terms and conditions sections to have all the information available.</p>

                <p>Once all the design part of our project was developed, we went on to define the business model part,
                    which is central to understand how SearchOnAct would work in reality.

                <p>It was also very useful in defining and specifying the actors involved, as well as the

                    the users we are targeting, the type of relationship we want to have with them and the channels we
                    are going to use to do this.
                    And last but not least, the revenue streams, i.e. the sources of income that we have based on a
                    pay-per-click advertising business model in which we generate our revenue through user clicks on
                    promoted ads
                    and we return most of our revenue (70%) to our social partners and use a smaller part for all the
                    resources necessary for the product development.
